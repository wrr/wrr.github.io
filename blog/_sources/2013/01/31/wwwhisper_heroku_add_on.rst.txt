wwwhisper Heroku add-on
=======================

I've worked recently on making `wwwhisper authorization
<https://github.com/wrr/wwwhisper>`_ available as a service for Heroku
applications. This greatly simplifies wwwhisper setup and
management. You can enable wwwhisper add-on for any Ruby based
application with just `3 lines of
config <https://github.com/wrr/rack-wwwhisper/blob/master/heroku-doc.md>`_!

Following Heroku add-on development processes, the wwwhisper add-on is
now in alpha testing phase and needs to be successfully used by
several users before it can move to closed beta, then open beta and
finally be officially released.

A grand plan is to offer a basic free plan and a fully-featured paid
plan to cover the cost of infrastructure and support further
development of wwwhisper.
