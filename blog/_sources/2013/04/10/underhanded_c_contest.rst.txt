Underhanded C Contest
=====================

The Underhanded C Contest is in a way an opposite of the Obfuscated C
Code Contest. The task is to write a readable and elegant piece of
code that looks legitimate but hides a malicious feature. The feature
should ideally look like an unfortunate mistake, not something
intentionally added.

The contest is now back after four years of inactivity and `the 2009
results are finally posted
<https://web.archive.org/web/20131205052658/http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~scraver/underhanded/>`_. Here is my `runner-up 2009
entry <https://github.com/wrr/underhanded-c/blob/master/luggage.c>`_.
