wwwhisper add-on update
=======================

The wwwhiser add-on is now in open beta. It can finally be enabled for
any Rails or Rack based application that runs on Heroku! `Give it a
try <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/wwwhisper>`_. Because
integration with the add-on is provided via Rack middleware, the cost
is minimal; there is no need to write any code, few lines of config do
the job.
