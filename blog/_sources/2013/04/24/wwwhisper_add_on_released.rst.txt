wwwhisper add-on released
=========================

The `authorization add-on for Heroku
<https://elements.heroku.com/addons/wwwhisper/>`_ is finally out of beta. A
huge thank you to everyone who has tried the add-on during the testing
phases!

Plans and pricing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three plans are currently available:

- **Starter** is a free plan that allows to grant access to a
  protected application to a single user. The plan gives an easy way
  to try wwwhisper. It should also cover the needs of people who are
  developing web applications alone or who would like to conveniently
  host any privately accessible application on Heroku.

- **Basic** plan allows to grant access to an application to up to ten
  people. The plan should cover the needs of a team working together,
  or sharing an application with clients or early adopters. It is also
  intended for small publicly accessible sites that need to have some
  locations protected, for example an admin web interface. The add-on
  allows to easily restrict access to such locations and frees
  developers from worrying about the authorization logic. It can also
  provide protection if an available authorization mechanism has
  security holes.

- **Plus** plan supports sites with bigger traffic and allows for up
  to 100 authorized users.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

If you have any feedback about available features or pricing please
send an email to `wwwhisper-service@mixedbit.org
<mailto:wwwhisper-service@mixedbit.org>`_. This will help greatly to
prioritize a todo list. Currently following items
are considered:

- Authorization middleware for more frameworks (node.js, wsgi, ...).

- An option to set custom texts on a sign-in page.

- Improvements to the admin web interface to conveniently manage 100+
  users.

- A plugin for a ``heroku`` command line tool to perform wwwhisper
  admin operations (grant, revoke access).

- Allow to use the service outside of the Heroku platform.
