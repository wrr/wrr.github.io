wwwhisper add-on for Node.js
============================

The `wwwhisper Heroku add-on
<https://elements.heroku.com/addons/wwwhisper/>`_ is now available for
Node.js. As with the Ruby Rails/Rack version the setup is just a
matter of three lines of config that enable the wwwhisper auth
middleware.

One of the goals of wwwhisper is to decouple authentication and
authorization logic from the application business logic. Such approach
allows to easily enable auth without changing business logic at all,
but it has also security benefits. `The Open Web Application Security
Project summarizes it nicely
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Authorization#Centralized_authorization_routines>`_:

    'A common mistake is to perform an authorization check by cutting
    and pasting an authorization code snippet into every page
    containing sensitive information. Worse yet would be re-writing
    this code for every page. Well written applications centralize
    access control routines, so if any bugs are found, they can be
    fixed once and the results apply throughout the application
    immediately.'
