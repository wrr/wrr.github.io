Shapespark
==========

`Shapespark <https://www.shapespark.com>`_ is a company that my
friend Wojtek and I have started, and it has been the center of our attention
during the last couple of months.

Our goal is to build a tool for professional architects and interior
designers to create WebGL-based real-time interactive
visualizations. We focus on the quality of visualizations, utilizing
physically-based rendering techniques to calculate lighting, which is
crucial for giving 3D scenes a sense of realism. We are also
experimenting with Oculus Rift, which turns out to be a quite useful
tool for presenting architectural designs.

Our `first visualization
<https://demo.shapespark.com/old-brewery/>`_
has already received compliments from many WebGL enthusiasts, including `Mr.doob
<https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/498873126055608320>`_, the famous
author of the Three.js library :D.

Overall, this is a very interesting venture, with so many new areas to
explore. You can expect more WebGL-related content and demos on this
blog, although we will probably start a Shapespark blog at some point.
