Hello, I'm Janek (or shortly Jan), a Software Engineer with main interests in
distributed systems, software design, computer networks and security.

I plan to keep this blog technical and write mostly about stuff that
is not widely covered elsewhere.

I hold a Master's and engineering degree in Computer Science. I had a
privilege of being mentored by Len Sassaman while developing
Firekeeper. I've also worked at Google for several years. Currently I share
time between contracting jobs and an attempt to bootstrap a
`business <https://addons.heroku.com/wwwhisper/>`_.
