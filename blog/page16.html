            <h1><a href="2012/11/05/sibling_domains_cookies_isolation_.html">Sibling domains cookies isolation</a></h1>
<p>Recently Iâ€™ve spent some time studying the topic of cookies isolation
for sibling domains. Relevant information is scattered through various
resources, as a result, the issue is often misunderstood.</p>
<p>Sibling domains are subdomains that share a common suffix which is not
a public suffix. For example, <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> and
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.example.com</span></span> are sibling domains, because <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example.com</span></span> is
not a public suffix; <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.co.uk</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.co.uk</span></span> are not sibling
domains because <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">co.uk</span></span> is a public suffix. Mozilla maintains <a class="reference external" href="https://publicsuffix.org">a
list</a> of public suffixes that is used by
Firefox, Chrome and Opera. IE has its own list.</p>
<p>Browsers implement weaker isolation policy for sibling domains than
for completely separate domains: a site can set cookies for its
siblings.</p>
<div class="section" id="cookie-domain-attribute">
<h2>Cookie domain attribute</h2>
<p>Usually sites set cookies without a domain attribute. If <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span>
returns an HTTP header:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Set-Cookie:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sid</span><span class="o">=</span>abc<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Expires</span><span class="o">=</span>Wed,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">13</span>-Jan-2021<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">22</span>:23:01<span class="w"> </span>GMT<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>it sets a cookie that is scoped to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span>
(<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.foo.example.com</span></span> in case of Internet Explorer) and does not
affect sibling sites. But browsers allow cookies to have the domain
attribute set to a suffix of a domain name (providing it is not a
public suffix):</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Set-Cookie:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sid</span><span class="o">=</span>abc<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Domain</span><span class="o">=</span>.example.com<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Expires</span><span class="o">=</span>Wed,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">13</span>-Jan-2021<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">22</span>:23:01<span class="w"> </span>GMT<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Such cookie is scoped to all <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.example.com</span></span> sites. The domain
attribute is not sent back with requests. If a cookie has an
acceptable value, <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> has no way to tell that it was set
by a sibling site.</p>
<p>It is important to understand security consequences of this
policy. The isolation between siblings is not completely broken,
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.example.com</span></span> can not access DOM or read cookies that belong to
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span>. It can only set its own cookies that are then sent to
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-subdomains">
<h2>Why subdomains?</h2>
<p>Often subdomains are used by a single organization that controls all
sibling sites. In such case danger is limited, because all sites are
trusted. The sibling domains isolation policy was likely introduced to make
life of such organizations easier. You can have
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">login.your-company.com</span></span>, that sets a session cookie for all
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.you-company.com</span></span> sites.</p>
<p>The problem arises when sibling domains are given to different, not
necessarily trusted organizations. If a site that was given a subdomain
can supply its own server-side or JavaScript code, it can set cookies
for sibling sites that belong to others.</p>
<p>Professional sites almost always use dedicated domains. A dedicated
domain is reasonably cheap and easy to setup, although still quite
difficult for less tech-savvy people. Probably the biggest benefit of
subdomains are shared SSL certificates. Certificates infrastructure
was designed for online businesses and is way too hard to use for
amateur sites. Yet, we store more and more sensitive things online
that deserve a proper cryptographic protection. Having a subdomain
from a provider that offers a shared SSL certificate is today the
easiest way to have encrypted HTTP connections to the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exploiting-weaker-isolation">
<h2>Exploiting weaker isolation</h2>
<p>The simplest trick, but usually of negligible impact, is for
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.example.com</span></span> to set a cookie with a domain
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.example.com</span></span> that has a name recognized by <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> but
an incorrect value. In case of session cookies this can cause
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> user to be logged out - a minor annoyance.</p>
<p>A more serious attack can be executed against a site that uses not
signed cookies as a storage space for user settings. Such cookies can
be replaced by the evil sibling. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Set-Cookie:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">MyTheme</span><span class="o">=</span>BarbiePink<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Domain</span><span class="o">=</span>.example.com<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Expires</span><span class="o">=</span>Wed,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">13</span>-Jan-2021<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">22</span>:23:01<span class="w"> </span>GMT<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This can be easily avoided by either signing cookies with a server key
or storing all setting on the server.</p>
<p>The truly dangerous attack is an equivalent of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Forging_login_requests">Login Cross Site
Request Forgery</a>. If
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.example.com</span></span> obtained a legitimate session cookie for
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span>, it can set this cookie for some user of
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> that visited <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.example.com</span></span>, thus logging
the user as someone else. As with the login CSRF, the impact of the
attack depends on the nature of the site. For nonsensitive sites such
as forums, wikis, blogs, the impact is minor, the user will be posting
as someone else. For sites that store sensitive information such as
online shops that store credit card numbers or a web search that
stores private queries history, the successful attack can be fatal. The
sensitive data can become exposed to the attacker.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pseudo-protection">
<h2>Pseudo-protection</h2>
<p>There is no elegant and reliable way for a sibling site to protect
against the attack. Legacy <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109">RFC 2109</a> required browsers to send the
domain attribute back to the server. This was a great idea that would
enable web applications to distinguish cookies set by siblings.
Unfortunately, it was never implemented.</p>
<p>A seemingly appealing solution, that could be employed in some
scenarios, would be to configure a trusted reverse proxy that talks to
all <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.example.com</span></span> sites to drop responses that try to set cookies with
the domain attribute set to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.example.com</span></span>. This doesnâ€™t work, because
cookies can be also set from JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another idea is for <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> to overwrite cookies that were set
with domain <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.example.com</span></span>.  Unfortunately, returning:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Set-Cookie:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sid</span><span class="o">=</span>xyz<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Domain</span><span class="o">=</span>.example.com<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Expires</span><span class="o">=</span>Wed,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">13</span>-Jan-1990<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">22</span>:23:01<span class="w"> </span>GMT<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>wonâ€™t do the job, because cookies are uniquely identified by a name,
a domain and a path. So if <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">evil.example.com</span></span> sets a cookie:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Set-Cookie:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sid</span><span class="o">=</span>SomeValidSid<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Domain</span><span class="o">=</span>.example.com<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Path</span><span class="o">=</span>/auth<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Expires</span><span class="o">=</span>Wed,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">13</span>-Jan-2021<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">22</span>:23:01<span class="w"> </span>GMT<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo.example.com</span></span> needs to overwrite it with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Set-Cookie:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sid</span><span class="o">=</span>xyz<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Domain</span><span class="o">=</span>.example.com<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Path</span><span class="o">=</span>/auth<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Expires</span><span class="o">=</span>Wed,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">13</span>-Jan-1990<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">22</span>:23:01<span class="w"> </span>GMT<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This means that with each response cookies returned by the server
would need to cover all meaningful paths that the server uses. Very
ugly and very impractical. The technique would still not fully prevent
the attack, it would only make it more difficult. The sibling could still set
cookies that would be included in some requests and then dropped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="protection">
<h2>Protection</h2>
<p>An elegant solution, and the only that truly works today, is to
request the top domain (<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">example.com</span></span>) to be added to the Public
Suffix List maintained by Mozilla. Sites can not set cookies scoped to
a domain name that is on the list. Many popular services that give
subdomains to users are on the list (Google App Engine, Opera Unite,
Red Hat OpenShift, DynDns). Adding a domain to the list is simple,
there is no heavyweight process guarding it. Unfortunately, not all
browsers use the list.</p>
<p>There is an idea to store information about public suffixes in
DNS. This seems like a place where this information really belongs and
is much more elegant than the centralized list. Hopefully weâ€™ll see
something like this in a future!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references">
<h2>References</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/">Tangled Web</a> is a great book
that deeply covers browser security.</p>
<p>A document that accurately describes how browsers handle cookies is
<a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">RFC 6265</a>. Earlier RFCs were
wishlists, never fully implemented.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve researched this topic while setting up a site on the Red Hat
OpenShift platform. OpenShift gives HTTPS enabled subdomains to users
(<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.rhcloud.com</span></span> addresses). It turned out the OpenShift crew was
not aware of the cookie isolation problem, but they fixed the problem
and added OpenShift to the Mozilla Public Suffix List.</p>
