        A log of a conversation with the Google Gemini LLM for the
        automatic generation of Python unit tests. See
        the <a href="/blog/2024/12/16/improving_unit_test_coverage_with_gemini.html">blog

You are a programmer working on a Python project. Your job
is to add missing unit tests to the project. All the project files are
attached. Study carefully the existing source files and unit tests.
Your added tests need to match the style and naming conventions used
in the project. Be consistent.

You are interacting with a computer that will be writing to disk,
executing and committing to git repository tests created by you.

First, wait for the computer to issue the following command:

###
ADD_TEST_FOR: file_path
TEST_COVERAGE:
###

In this command, file_path is a path of the python file to test
relative to the project root directory. Examine carefully the source
code of this file to understand the functionality that needs to be
tested. Also examine the existing tests for the file (if any), add
tests only for logic that is not already tested by the existing
files. If a file is called foo_bar.py, the tests for such file are
usually called test_foo_bar.py or tests_for_bar.py and are often
placed in a separate 'tests' folder.

TEST_COVERAGE: is followed by a source code of the file with each line
prefixed with a coverage information like this:

  # some function
> def h(x):
-     if 0:  # pragma: no cover
-         pass
>     if x == 1:
!         a = 1
>     else:
>         a = 2

'>' prefix means that the line is covered by tests.
'!' prefix means that the line is not covered by test. Focus on these
lines, your tests should include logic to execute them.
Lack of prefix means that line is not executable and doesn't need to
be covered (for example a comment or an empty line).
 '-' prefix means that line is explicitly excluded from coverage testing
 and doesn't need to be covered by tests.

Special response "TEST_COVERAGE: WHOLE_FILE_NOT_COVERED" means
that not a single line of the file is currently covered by unit tests.

Next, you need to create a single unit test file for the requested
file to test. Write the following command (enclosed in ### below) for
the computer:

###
WRITE_TEST_FILE: file_path_with_name

file_content

END_TEST_FILE
your_comments
###

Where:
file_path_with_name is a path of the added test file relative to the
project root directory. Important: all added file names (but not
directories) must start with the test_gemini_ prefix (for example
tests/test_gemini_quick_sort.py is correct). Do not create new tests
directories, put tests in the already existing ones.

file_content is a Python code of the test file to be added. Do not use
any special encoding or character escaping for the Python code. Also
do not wrap the code in any quotes and do not start it with the
'python' prefix. All names of added TestCase classes need to have
GeminiTest suffix (for example QuickSortGeminiTest). All added test
methods need to have test_gemini_ prefix (for example
test_gemini_quick_sort_empty_list). Follow the project programming
style and PEP 8 code style recommendations.

your_comments can include any description of what you are doing, what
problems did you encounter with your tests and how do you try to solve
them.

The computer (not you) will respond with a message in the following
format:

TEST_RUN_STATUS:
FAILURE_MESSAGE:
TEST_COVERAGE:
PROMPT:

Where TEST_RUN_STATUS: is followed by either 'OK' if the added test
file executed successfully or 'FAILED' in other cases.
FAILURE_MESSAGE: is present only if the tests failed and is followed by
the errors printed by the Python interpreter. This can include stack
trace or syntax errors.
TEST_COVERAGE: is followed by an updated information about the
coverage of the tested file. It has the form already described above.
PROMPT: is optional and can be followed by additional instructions.

Please don't just add a single test function to cover all untested
functionality. Instead, add a separate test function for each tested
case.

Examine carefully the returned values, if there are any syntax errors
or test assertion failures, continue to modify the test file and write
it again until there are no more errors. Not all test assertion code
can be made to be passing. It is possible that your test will uncover
an actual error in the program logic. In such case the unit test added
by you will be failing. Annotate such tests with a comment and comment
out the failing test assertion like this:

# TODO: fix the program logic to make this test pass:
# self.assertEqual([1, 2, 3], quick_sort([1, 3, 2]))

FAILURE_MESSAGE result of the WRITE_TEST_FILE command must be
inspected to ensure it does not contain any syntax errors. Continue to
modify the test file to fix any syntax errors.

Once your test file is ready, runs without any errors, with any
assertions that are failing due to a bug in a program commented out,
and has good, preferably 100% coverage (no lines marked with !)
commit it using the following command (enclosed in ### below):

###
COMMIT: file_path_with_name
commit_message
END_COMMIT_MESSAGE
###

Where commit_message is a git commit message describing the
change. Separate subject from body with a blank line. Start the
subject with 'Gemini: ' prefix. Wrap lines at 72
characters. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph. Use the
imperative mood in the subject line. Include information in the body
that the test was generated automatically.

Issue commands one by one, never issue more than one command in a
single message. COMMIT command should be issued only after you have
examined the computer response from the last WRITE_TEST_FILE command
and the computer responded with "TEST_RUN_STATUS: OK" and most of the
tested file lines are covered.

After committing the test file, wait for instructions to create a next
test file or to TERMINATE.

Do not write any text that does not respect the communication protocol
defined above. The computer only understands these two commands from
you: WRITE_TEST_FILE and COMMIT. The computer will not be able to parse
any other messages correctly and can fail if you provide other input.

COMMIT: tests/test_gemini_num_decodings.py
Gemini: Add Tests for Num Decodings

This commit adds unit tests for the num_decodings and
num_decodings2 functions in the
algorithms/dp/num_decodings.py module.

The tests cover cases for empty strings, single-digit
strings, two-digit strings, three-digit strings,
leading zeros, double zeros, invalid two-digit strings,
and other cases.

The tests were generated automatically.
