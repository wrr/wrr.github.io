        <p class="project-desc"><a href="https://www.shapespark.com">Shapespark</a>
        is a company founded by my friend Wojtek Matyjewicz and me in
        2014. It provides software for creating web-based interactive
        3D spaces.  Shapespark is used mostly for real estate
        visualizations, virtual showrooms, and virtual art
        galleries. Shapespark was acquired in 2018 and I have left the
        company in 2023. Today Shapespark is a top choice for
        web-based architecture visualization.

            A one day hack</a> based on Speech Trainer. The application
          replays everything you say with a short delay,
          which momentarily confuses the brain and disturbs

          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200113092924/http://firekeeper.mozdev.org/">Firekeeper</a>
            was a Firefox add-on that provided Intrusion Detection
            System capabilities. The add-on scanned the browser requests and
            responses for traffic that matched known attack signatures
            and alerted the user of detected attack
            attempts. Firekeeper used rules in a
            <a href="https://snort.org/">Snort-compatible</a>
            format. Because the scanning was done in a browser,
            Firekeeper was able to access and scan unencrypted HTTPS
            traffic. I had the privilege of being mentored by Len
            Sassaman and Meredith L. Patterson while working on
            Firekeeper during the Google Summer of Code. The project
            is no longer maintained.

        <p class="project-desc">
          <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430155">nsITraceableChannel</a>
          is a Firefox API that I co-authored while working on
          Firekeeper. At that time, Firefox did not provide a reliable
          way for add-ons to intercept browser traffic. Firekeeper and
          Firebug (which was than the top tool used by web developers)
          needed to resort to dirty hacks to provide HTTP
          request/response inspection functions. Jan Odvarko's from
          Firebug <a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/nsitraceablechannel-intercept-http-traffic/">explains
          the API</a> in more detail.
